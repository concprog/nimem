# Test script for invalidation
# Run this to check if "Alice lives in London" invalidates "Alice lives in Wonderland"
# python main.py ingest "Alice lives in Wonderland."
# python main.py ingest "Alice lives in London."
# python main.py recall "Alice" -> Should show London and NOT Wonderland (or show Wonderland as expired if we filtered correctly)
